*Repeating from the project report*

In this folder:
1) **SUBMITTED_VERSION_with_cleaned_comments.ipynb**: a slightly cleaned version of the submission file selected for the competition; reproduces results (**NO CHANGES TO ARCHITECTURE** -  we just removed stale commented out code chunks and improved print statements, as we werenâ€™t expecting to select this older submission for the competition)
2) Two other files from our later submission attempts, demonstrating the sorts of additional things we were trying without added success
